## Live Demo at MHacks, Detroit, 2014

This repo contains the code for the live demo done at MHacks, 2014

## What is it about?

The demo is about using YQL to retrive virtually anything from the web.

So, you don't need to learn any provider specific API whatsoever. If you need to integrate with Flickr, good. If you need to get data from Netflix, you don't need to read that documentation.

## Setup

1. Install `nodejs` from http://www.nodejs.org
2. Clone this repo on your local box - `git clone git@github.com:gvaish/mhacks-2014.git`
3. Setup the modules - `npm install`
4. Run the server - `node app.js`

## Point of interest

The following files would be of interest:

1. `public/index.html`: Created during the demo - Weather data using YQL
2. `public/weather.html`: Copy of `index.html`
3. `public/flickr.html`: Flickr data using YQL
4. `public/final.html`: Flickr and Weather data using YQL
